# Chapter 1: Introduction to Computers and Programming

# Short Answer

1. Both main memory and secondary storage are types of memory. Describe the difference between the two.
    Ans.) Main Memory (aka  RAM: Random Access Memory) and secondary storage are both different types of memory. The biggest difference is that of impermanence.

          **Main Memory (MM)**: is impermanent, faster, and holds currently used instructions/programs. The   
            MM is called *Random Access* as the CPU is able to quickly access the memory at any location at *random*.
            It loses its contents should it lose power. 
            Expensive.
            Think of it as a Chef's cook bench where they hold ingredients for the recipe that they're cooking up. 

          **Secondary Storage**: is non-volatile long-term storage, where memory can hold data for long periods of time, even when there is no power to the computer. 
            Programs are normally stored in here and loaded onto the main memory as needed. 
            Relatively inexpensive. 
            Think of it as the Chef's fridge, more room for storing ingredients and such, but a bit of a hassle to get them out.

### Algorithm Workbench
Draw hierarchy charts or flowcharts that depict the programs described below. (See Appendix C for instructions on creating flowcharts.) 

30. Available Credit
The following steps should be followed in a program that calculates a customer’s available credit:
1. Display the message “Enter the customer’s maximum credit.”
2. Wait for the user to enter the customer’s maximum credit.
3. Display the message “Enter the amount of credit used by the customer.”
4. Wait for the user to enter the customer’s credit used.
5. Subtract the used credit from the maximum credit to get the customer’s available credit.
6. Display a message that shows the customer’s available credit.

31. Sales Tax
Design a hierarchy chart or flowchart for a program that calculates the total of a retail
sale. The program should ask the user for:
– The retail price of the item being purchased
– The sales tax rate
Once these items have been entered, the program should calculate and display:
– The sales tax for the purchase
– The total of the sale

32. Account Balance
Design a hierarchy chart or flowchart for a program that calculates the current balance
in a savings account. The program must ask the user for:
– The starting balance
– The total dollar amount of deposits made
– The total dollar amount of withdrawals made
– The monthly interest rate
Once the program calculates the current balance, it should be displayed on the screen.

Predict the Result
Questions 33–35 are programs expressed as English statements. What would each display
on the screen if they were actual programs?

33. The variable x starts with the value 0.
The variable y starts with the value 5.
Add 1 to x.
Add 1 to y.
Add x and y, and store the result in y.
Display the value in y on the screen.

34. The variable x starts with the value 20.
The variable y starts with the value 10.
Store the value of x in a variable t.
Store the value of y in x.
Store the value of t in y.
Display the value of x on the screen.
Display the value of y on the screen.

35. The variable a starts with the value 1.
The variable b starts with the value 10.
The variable c starts with the value 100.
The variable x starts with the value 0.
Store the value of c times 3 in x.
Add the value of b times 6 to the value already in x.
Add the value of a times 5 to the value already in x.
Display the value in x on the screen.
Find the error

36. The following pseudocode algorithm has an error. The program is supposed to ask the
user for the length and width of a rectangular room, then display the room’s area. The
program must multiply the width by the length in order to determine the area. Find
the error.
area = width × length.
Display “What is the room’s width?”.
Input width.
Display “What is the room’s length?”.
Input length.
Display area.
